# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Damian Aldair and I am a person who likes to create new things, improve what already exists and solve problems as fast as possible.

I love developing apps for mobile devices and for computers and, of course, web apps, so I'm always studying and learning, like doctors ðŸ˜‰.

I got into the world of Flutter and from the beginning I loved it and I can't stop programming with it. But I also have in my plans to get to know, study and use other programming languages, frameworks, technologies, platforms, etc.
